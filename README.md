This pattern provides an example CDK application stack using TypeScript for the infrastructure and 4 different programming languages to implement an AWS Lambda function (all of them within a single stack). Each of the functions will use at least 1 external dependency to showcase how the function code is bundled together with its dependencies. The languages used in the pattern's Lambda functions are:

JavaScript
Java 1.8 (with and without using Lambda Layers)
.NET Core 3.1
Python 3.7
